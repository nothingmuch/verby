=head1 NAME

Verby::Context - A sort of scratchpad every L<Verby::Step> gets from
L<Verby::Dispatcher>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	sub do {
		my $self = shift;
		my $context = shift;

		print $context->rockets; # get a value
gDi
		$context->milk("very"); # set a value
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A context has two roles in L<Verby>. The first is to control what a
L<Verby::Action> will do, by providing it with parameters, and the other is to
share variables that the action sets, so that other steps may have them too.

It is a mutable L<Verby::Config::Data> that derives from the global context.
