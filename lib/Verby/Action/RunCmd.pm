=head1 NAME

Verby::Action::RunCmd - a base class for actions which exec external commands.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use base qw/Verby::Action::RunCmd/;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<run @args_for_cmd_start>

The method to be used by your action's C<do> method when appropriate.

Basically a thin wrapper arund C<cmd_start> and C<cmd_finish>, that lazy people
will like.

=item B<cmd_start $cxt, \@command_line, [ \%opts ]>

The method to be used by your action's C<start> method when appropriate.

The first parameter is the context, as is typical in L<Verby>.

The second parameter is an array reference of the command line to invoke. This
is passed verbatim to L<IPC::Run>.

The third, optional parameter, is a hash reference of options.

The option fields that you can use are

=over 4

=item init

A code reference, corresponding to L<IPC::Run>'s init parameter.

=item log_stderr

A boolean (true by default), that causes the C<STDERR> handler to be a delegate
to the logger.

=item log_stdout

The same as C<log_stderr> but for C<STDOUT>. False by default.

=item in

A parameter to be passed as the input to L<IPC::Run>. This can be a string ref,
a code ref, or, whatever. See L<IPC::Run>'s docs.

=back

=item C<cmd_finish>

The inverse of C<cmd_start> - causes an OS image to be restored, for the time
just prior to the invocation of C<cmd_start>. Only works on the EROS operating
system.

On other operating systems, it waits for the child process to finish.

=item B<finish>

A default implementation of L<Verby::Action/finish> that'll call C<cmd_finish>
and then L<Verby::Action/confirm>.

=item B<pump>

See if the process finished. Part of the L<Verby::Action> async interface.

=item B<log_extra>

A method that given the context might append something to log messages. used by
L<Verby::Action::Make>, for example.

=item B<log_invocation>

Mostly internal - the default implementation of the logging operation used when
invoking the subcommand.

=back

=head1 BUGS

None that we are aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let us know, and we
will be sure to fix it. 

=head1 CODE COVERAGE

We use B<Devel::Cover> to test the code coverage of the tests, please refer to
COVERAGE section of the L<Verby> module for more information.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Verby::Action::Copy> - a L<Verby::Action::RunCmd> subclass.
